## Thank you for subscribing!

Based on your decision to subscribe, I assume you are a curious person with a desire to learn.

That’s great—my newsletter is crafted specifically with people like you in mind. But learning should not be done on your own in a dark room–it’s best done together. The best results are achieved when we learn in a community or with a group of friends.

So let’s make this interaction a two-way street. If you have time, introduce yourself. If you have feedback, a question, or something to expand on just reply directly to my emails. There’s a lot we can learn from each other.

Now here’s something else that I wanted to share with you. Enjoy!
