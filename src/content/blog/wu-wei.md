description: We can often relax for the same result.

What is the difference between a bike ride of 45 minutes, and a bike ride of 43 minutes?

Nope, it’s not just two minutes. Turns out that it’s much more than that.

Derek Sivers tells the story of how he took bike rides along a beautiful coastal route of 24 km in California.
Every time, he would give it his all–100% of his effort–and he would finish his bike ride, completely exhausted, in 43 minutes.
After doing this dozens of times, he got sick of it.

So next time, he decided to take it easy.
He biked the whole route with **50%** of his effort, enjoying the scenery and the wildlife.
There was no hurrying.
No straining.
Just a dude chilling on his bike, enjoying the scenery and beauty of it all.

And he loved it.

When he finished the route and looked at his watch, he couldn’t believe what he saw.

**45 minutes.**

This is how most of us go through work.
Always in a hurry, always straining to get things done.
All of that, for a trivial amount of time.

This story reminded me of how I used to drive to my work like a maniac to get there 5 minutes earlier.
It reminded me of those times when I would stress out because I had to stay longer, so I would try to get things done faster, getting even more stressed in the process.
It reminded me of quickly finishing a patient's history to “save time”.
I would then walk to my computer in a rush, probably saving a few seconds on the walk back.

It reminded me of all the days that I spent in a hurry, when I could have relaxed for the same result.

This story serves as a reminder that I should allow myself to relax more while I’m doing my work. However, this wisdom opposes the modern ideas of effort and busyness, where both are often seen as a virtue.

## Busyness as a virtue

People brag about being busy and the “hustle” culture is more popular than ever.

Sometimes it’s difficult to distance myself from this culture.
It occasionally succeeds in pulling me in for short periods of time.
In these periods, I am always worse off for it.

I forget to relax, focus too much on results, and my stress levels always end up increasing.
It feels as if I am doing the same amount of work with more effort, as if I’m swimming against the current of a river. I feel like Derek Sivers taking a bike ride with 100% effort, only to gain two minutes and lose my well-being in the process.

But my days aren’t always like this.
Some days I am the complete opposite.

On these days, I don’t stress.
Whatever work I do, I thoroughly enjoy it.
I don’t focus on the results and find myself completely immersed in whatever I’m doing.
This allows me to relax and be happy while I’m doing the work, instead of delaying it until the achievement of some momentary goal.

These days are my favorite, and after learning the concept of Wu Wei, I am starting to understand why.

## Wu Wei

Wu Wei is a concept from Daoist Philosophy.
The most accurate translations that I could find were “Effortless Action” and “Not Forcing”.

Derek Sivers unknowingly practiced Wu Wei in his bike ride.
At first, he tried to force a certain result: completing the bike ride as fast as possible.
The bike rides sucked because of the effort it took and it always left him feeling drained.

But after he stopped to force a certain outcome, he was able to relax and finally enjoy the bike ride for the beauty that it was.
He completely transformed the quality of his bike ride, for a trade-off of only two minutes.

This is Wu Wei in action.
Wu Wei is about not forcing results and _sailing_ with the river, instead of swimming against it.

Wu Wei doesn’t force results because the world and its forces cannot be governed. Similar to another philosophy that I love (Stoicism), it makes a sharp distinction between the things that are in our control and the things that aren’t.

> Stop trying to control. Let go of fixed plans and concepts, and the world will govern itself.

_- Tao Te Ching 57_

## Modern times

Our culture is in many ways the opposite of Wu Wei.
Whereas Wu Wei is about harmony and living in accordance with nature, the modern world is about using nature for personal gain.

Science armed us with knowledge, and the knowledge provided us with the utility to bend nature to our will in many different ways.
We have converted natural resources into the products that fuel consumerism, fossil fuels into the mechanical energy needed to take us to our work, friends, and holidays abroad.
We have harnessed the power of atoms into weapons of mass destruction that threaten the end of our species and many others, aside from the millions that have already gone extinct because of us. We have enslaved 1.5 billion cows to “optimize” our food intake. There are now more people dying from the consequences of overconsumption than starvation.

This allowed us to become the wealthiest, dangerous and most powerful species that ever inhabited the planet.
But it comes at a hidden cost.

We now find ourselves trying to optimize everything, similar to how science tries to optimize its ways of energy conversion and the creation of new products.
Just like fossil fuels, nature and resources, time has also become something that must be exploited for gain.

There was a time when nobody really cared what time it was, and how long it took to finish a task. This was before the Industrial Revolution.

The Industrial Revolution normalized the modern clock as we know it.
It took the coordination of hundreds of workers for an industrial factory to run efficiently.
If one employee overslept for 5 minutes and couldn’t operate a machine, it stalled all the other machines.

So they gave everyone a clock and told them to be there at 07:00 sharp.
They started paying their workers by the hour, instead of a vaguely defined “day of work”.
Time enabled industries to squeeze their employees for more labor and increase their profits.

The concept of “time = money” was born and working with a clock was so efficient that everyone started doing it.
It was also in this period that the seeds of the modern productivity movement were planted.

## Modern productivity

The productivity movement specializes in optimizing every second of your time.
It lures us with the promise of a fulfilled life and a future where we will finally be on top of everything, or better said "in control" of everything.

Sadly, such a future doesn’t exist.
It doesn’t matter how efficiently you can complete your tasks if a new one continuously takes its place.

We are already the most efficient population that ever existed.
We don’t have to walk miles for water, we can travel long distances with our cars and contacting someone on the other side of the world can be done in an instant.
We have dishwashers, laundry machines, vacuum cleaners and other appliances that make our daily life so much easier. We have software, apps, and computers that automated tons of boring tasks.

Despite all of this efficiency, we are still busy. I call this the “efficiency paradox.”

Time is like an unstoppable conveyor belt, bringing us new tasks as fast as we eliminate old ones. Efficiency doesn’t increase the control you have over the belt, it only causes it to speed up.

There were some who predicted that technology would bring us so much convenience that our biggest challenge would be finding enough activities to fill our day.
A few hundred years ago it must have seemed like a rational prediction.
But it was way off the mark.

## What we can learn from Wu Wei

I see Wu Wei as an antidote to the modern hustle culture and life on the conveyor belt.
Wu Wei doesn’t try to control or optimize. Nor does it force results.

Wu Wei accepts.

It allows things to take the time it needs, and challenges us to align our actions with the things we can’t change. During our rise to the most powerful species of the planet, we have failed to find balance, not just in nature, but also in ourselves.

We have become so efficient in energy conversion and building new products that we started to destroy nature on a scale that’s never seen before. In the process, we have also learned to exploit time as a resource.  
The majority of our society now values hustle, busyness and results above effortless action and enjoyment of the work itself.

Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not trying to bash hard work.

Hard work is admirable.

But even more admirable is the person who can resist the urge to hurry and optimize. A person that allows himself to relax for the same results.

> In a world geared for hurry, the capacity to resist the urge to hurry—to allow things to take the time they take—is a way to gain purchase on the world, to do the work that counts, and to derive satisfaction from the doing itself, instead of deferring all your fulfillment to the future.

-_Oliver Burkeman_

When you rush through work, you don’t enjoy the work itself.
You enjoy being done with the work.

In a fast-paced world, the ability to slow down is becoming more important.
More than ever, patience is a virtue.
It allows us to relax while we work and enables us to find balance in the things we do.

I think that balance and relaxation is the key to a durable career with the best results, no matter what you end up doing. Hurrying is rarely the answer.

This lesson is all around us.
But we need to slow down enough to see it unfold.

In the words of Lao Tzu:

> Nature doesn’t hurry, yet everything is accomplished.
