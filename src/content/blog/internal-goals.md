description: There are two ways to set goals. Here's how to do it right.
---

Imagine a guy named Terry, who is not satisfied with his job.

He wants a promotion.
He tells his boss about it and starts working his butt off for the next 10 years.

During his 10-year struggle, he often gets anxious because he worries about not getting promoted.
And occasionally he gets frustrated because the boss doesn’t seem to notice his efforts.
After 10 years of striving and repeating the daily motions, he still hasn’t been promoted.
He feels miserable, and he can’t help but wonder if he wasted 10 years of his life.

Now imagine a girl named Ciri, who is also interested in a promotion.

She tells her boss about this.
But she formulates a different goal: she wants to develop herself.
She focuses on getting better every day.
Ciri almost never gets anxious or frustrated.

She is achieving her goals daily and therefore feels content and at peace.
She isn’t worried about getting noticed–she doesn’t need anyone to notice her.
Looking back after 10 years she feels satisfied with her personal growth.

In the end, she also didn’t get the promotion.
She doesn’t mind.
It was never her goal in the first place.

Most of us live our lives like Terry, and little like Ciri.
I am an advocate of the method of Ciri.
She is **internalizing her goals.**<sup>1</sup>

## External goals

External goals are goals that focus on material rewards and other people's opinions.
Wealth, fame, titles, twitter-followers and pleasing your boss are all examples of external goals.

Pursuing external goals has drawbacks.
External goals are a decision to strive toward something in the future.
The underlying belief is that your current situation is not good enough.
The more you strive towards an external goal, the more you reinforce this belief.
Over time, you will become less satisfied with your current situation.

**External goals are self-imposed contracts that keep you unhappy until you get what you want.**<sup>2</sup>

External goals are also outside of your control.
Results aren’t guaranteed.
Factors outside of your control need to work together so that you can achieve that goal.

In the example above, a position must first be available, then you need to be the best candidate and after that, the boss still has to choose you.

When things don’t go according to plan, externalists will find themselves disappointed–maybe even miserable.
Looking back, they may find that their precious days were wasted in the frustration and anxiety that comes with striving for something outside of their control.

Setting external goals begs an important question.
They assume they will be happier or more satisfied when they achieve their goal.
But how long will it last?
For externalists, the goalposts are always moving.

The concept of enough is hard to fathom when all you know are external goals.
A true externalist will always chase the next big thing, never reflecting on why his satisfaction doesn’t seem to last.

## Internal goals

An interal goal is a goal that doesn't require any external factors.

The main advantage is that you are in full control.
Results are virtually guaranteed.
And the control you have over your goals rids you of anxiety and frustration.

Results are also more immediate.
Internal goals enable you to be satisfied in the present, instead of delaying the satisfaction until the achievement of something external.
Internalists achieve their goals every day–for the rest of their life.
This puts them in a happier state of mind.

A true internalist like Ciri is invincible.
Everything she wants is within her control.
All the good things in life, she gets it from _herself_.

An externalist believes the good things reside _in the world_ he lives in.
Everything he wants is outside of his control.

Another way to think about it is that the internalist focuses on the journey, whereas the externalist focuses on the destination.

Most of our life is the journey.
That feeling people get after achieving their destination is short-lived.
It’s a much better strategy to make the journey enjoyable.

Don’t make it your goal to change the world.  
Make it your goal to **do your best** to bring about certain changes.
Even if you fail to change the world, you can rest easy knowing that you gave it your all.

Internalize your goals.
