description: The fascinating science behind why some babies are born with tails.
---

Once in a blue moon, a baby is born with a tail.

A true tail, filled with muscles, bones, blood vessels and nerve fibers.
I don’t know the current amount of reported cases, but in 2012 it was less than 40.<sup>1</sup>
In some of those cases, the babies were even able to move/contract their tails when they got emotional!

How the fuck does this happen?
I can understand mutations that cause heart defects or metabolic defects.
One single mutation is all it takes for a gene to stop expressing itself, thereby causing all kinds of defects.
But how can they cause the appearance of body parts that humans don’t even have in the first place?

## The human embryo

It turns out that we already have what it takes to grow a tail.

During our first few weeks in the womb, we all develop a tail, only for it to regress a few weeks later.
We do this with a process called apoptosis, a.k.a. programmed cell death.
In species that do have tails, this same tail keeps growing and progresses into a full-fledged tail.
This pattern of building structures only to discard them is visible throughout our embryonal development.
For example, a human embryo develops three different kidneys, the first two discarded before the final kidney finally appears.

This raises the question: why do we develop all these structures, only for them to disappear?

We carry the answer to this question within us. In our DNA.

## Pseudogenes

We are a walking graveyard of dead genes.
Of the 30 000 unique genes that we carry, more than 2000 are inactive.
They serve no purpose.
They are dormant sleeper genes–a remnant of our ancestors.

These dormant sleeper genes are called pseudogenes, and virtually every species has them.
A famous example is the inactive gene that codes for teeth in chickens.
Chickens are believed to be descended from dinosaurs.
They lost their teeth around 60-80 million years ago.

A mutation caused the gene that codes for teeth to become deactivated.
Deactivated, so not completely erased.
The proof that they still could grow teeth came in 2006<sup>2</sup>, when a mutation caused the chickens to develop structures that resembled early tooth development.

In humans, the most famous pseudogene is the one that causes scurvy: GLO.
It’s called GLO because in other species it produces the enzyme L-gulono-y-lactone oxidase, used in making vitamin C from glucose.
Vitamin C is essential for our metabolism and virtually all mammals have the pathway to make it, except fruit bats, primates (that includes Homo Sapiens) and guinea pigs.
So as Homo Sapiens, we need to ingest enough vitamin C, which isn’t difficult if you eat some fruit or vegetables once in a while.

If you don't, you are likely to get scurvy: a serious disease resulting from a lack of vitamin C. Nowadays, it's common in refugees but sailors used to get it all the time back when they didn't bring any fruits on their long voyages.

Sidenote: if you don’t eat fruits and veggies and are currently suffering from tiredness, joint pains, weird spots on your skin, bleeding gums and teeth falling out, you may want to see a doctor.

Vitamin C is made in 4 steps. In primates the last step is missing, because of a mutation that inactivated the GLO gene. A single mutation made the whole pathway redundant, even though we can still perform the first few steps.
It has basically become a pseudo-pathway.
It exisits, but it's incomplete and does nothing.

And here’s the most fascinating part: all primates have the exact same mutation that caused the inactivation! More specifically, they all have the same missing nucleotide.

Either an intelligent designer made the same mistake in all primates and didn’t care to erase it, or the mutation that destroyed the ability to create vitamin C was present in the ancestor of all primates, and got passed on to its descendants.

The mutation itself must not have been a dealbreaker for these species. They were already consuming enough vitamin C from their diet, so they got away with it. But the sailors who forgot to bring fruits and veggies–not so much.

So in short, pseudogenes are basically deactivated genes that decided to stick around in our DNA.

Now, let’s get back to the baby with the tail.

## Atavism

A newborn with a true tail is an example of “Atavism”.
Atavism comes from the Latin word “Atavus” meaning great, great, great(!) grandfather.
Babies with tails had a mutation that inactivated the gene that causes tails to regress.
So the tail that we develop in the embryonal phase doesn’t regress, and you end up with a super saiy–I mean a baby with a tail.

The reason that we grow tails and kidneys in the womb that we never use, is because we still use parts of the developmental programs of our ancestors.

While cycling through these programs, the embryos start developing the traits that make us human, and in most cases, destroy the traits that don’t make us human.

It would be more efficient for babies to start directly as a tiny human embryo, and to progress into a full-grown newborn without ever developing tails or kidneys that we never end up using.
It would also be more efficient to erase all the pseudogenes.

But nature is like a lazy programmer–it never starts from scratch–it only makes small improvements to existing code.
Deleting all the pseudogenes that become inactivated over time is a hassle.
So is completely redesigning the way we go through our embryological development.

So it decides to make small improvements to the existing code instead, accepting the rest as it is.
This explains the weird detours we make during embryology, and also the existence of all those pseudogenes.

And more importantly, it also explains why some babies are born with tails. So because of pseudogenes and nature being a lazy programmer, we still grow tails in the womb. Normally, we have a gene that causes tails to regress. But when this gene mutates, it stops working and the tail fails to regress.

This results in a baby with a tail. Pretty cool.

The parents didn’t think it was cool at all and they agreed to surgically remove the tail.
So no one ever found out if the baby would have developed special powers.
