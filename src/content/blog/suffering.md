description: In "Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl explains how to find meaning in suffering—even inside concentration camps.
---

One of my favorite books of all time is written by Viktor Frankl, a psychiatrist who spent three years in 4 concentration camps.

After miraculously surviving that nightmare, he wrote a book about how we can deal with suffering–and even find meaning in it.
He called it “Man’s Search for Meaning”.
In the book he shares his experiences and builds up to a conclusion that can be summarized in one quote from Nietzche:

> He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how.

## The concentration camps

The living conditions in the concentration camps were awful.

The inmates were starved, sleep-deprived and forced to do extreme manual labor.
In these conditions, Viktor Frankl noticed how inmates varied from each other in their mindset.

A lot of people did not want to continue living in a concentration camp.
Everyone entertained the possibility of suicide. Some followed through.  
The most popular way was to “run into the wire”, referring to touching an electrically charged barbed wire.

A lot of the inmates had the belief that they would be reunited with their families before Christmas.
When this didn’t happen, some were unable to deal with this mental setback.
They gave up.

They died a few days later to seemingly unrelated causes, causing a sudden spike in casualties around Christmas.
A sickness may have caused their deaths, but Viktor Frankl concluded that it was not having the heart to continue that really killed them.

## A different attitude

But besides the group that didn’t feel like continuing, there was another group.
Men who somehow dealt with their grim reality in a different way.

> We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.

To choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.
_That_ was the fundamental difference.
The difference between the group that gave up, and the group that walked through the huts, comforting others.

Take for example the optimistic and philosophical attitude of Viktor Frankl towards suffering:

> If there is a meaning to life, then there also must be a meaning in suffering. Because life consists of suffering. If we believe life to be meaningful, then meaning can be found in every moment.

I believe that this is the core message of “Man’s Search for Meaning”.

Every moment has an opportunity for meaning.
Even in suffering, meaning can be found, depending on the attitude of the person.
But you cannot ask life what the meaning is.
Life asks _you_.
And you choose your own meaning.
Your own attitude.

When you want to help someone in a concentration camp, you need to give him meaning–a goal to strive for.

According to Viktor Frankl, even a concentration camp offered opportunities for meaning.
He writes:

> For what then matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one’s predicament into a human achievement. When we are no longer able to change a situation we are challenged to change ourselves.

He saw his suffering as an opportunity for inner achievement.
He used his unique situation to practice the moral values and character that comes from confronting his suffering.
Thereby becoming _worthy_ of his suffering.

> That which does not kill me, makes me stronger

-Nietzsche

## Logotherapy

Sometimes we need a person who can show us a better attitude toward life’s problems.
Seemingly meaningless hardships and suffering can suddenly become meaningful.
There is a great example of this in the book:

> Once, an elderly general practitioner consulted me because of his severe depression. He could not overcome the loss of his wife who had died two years before and whom he had loved above all else. Now, how could I help him? What should I tell him? Well, I refrained from telling him anything but instead confronted him with the question, “What would have happened, Doctor, if you had died first, and your wife would have had to survive you?” “Oh,” he said, “for her this would have been terrible; how she would have suffered!” Whereupon I replied, “You see, Doctor, such a suffering has been spared her, and it was you who have spared her this suffering—to be sure, at the price that now you have to survive and mourn her.

> He said no word but shook my hand and calmly left my office. In some way, suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice. Of course, this was no therapy in the proper sense since, first, his despair was no disease; and second, I could not change his fate; I could not revive his wife. But in that moment I did succeed in changing his attitude toward his unalterable fate inasmuch as from that time on he could at least see a meaning in his suffering.

It’s not easy to find meaning in suffering.
As we saw in the example above, it takes some creativity or a different perspective.
That’s why it helps to talk with a therapist.
They can ask you questions and force you to look at things from a different perspective.

> When we are no longer able to change a situation we are challenged to change ourselves.

Transforming suffering into something meaningful is a powerful skill.
All it takes is practice and a different attitude.
