My name is Vito.

This website is an "archive" of useful ideas, practical advice and a collection of my favourite scientific knowledge.
It’s a product of my curiosity and my desire to create useful content.

I received my medical degree after studying Medicine in the Netherlands at Radboud University.
After that, I worked in Psychiatry and Occupational Medicine.

I am now working in Geriatric Medicine.
Choosing a specialty is proving more difficult than I expected.
I don't really know what to specialize in, so I am getting my hands dirty and trying out different things.

## How can my work benefit you?

Everybody tries to solve the same question inside their head: "How can we live a good life?"
Most of this website is me trying to solve that same question--but in writing.
I read and collect the best ideas that I can find.
I then present them in interesting short-form articles.

I draw my inspiration from fields like:

- Philosophy
- Medicine
- Biology
- Psychology
- Behavioral Science

And more.

I try to learn in public.
Whenever I come across something interesting, I take notes.
And if I want to dive deeper or improve my thinking on a subject, I transform my notes into an article.
That final step, where I go from consuming to creating, is my favorite way of learning.
I learn and improve my thinking while also teaching something to my readers.
That’s why I love writing.

The best way to follow my work is by subscribing to my newsletter.
