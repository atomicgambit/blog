## Thank you for subscribing!

Based on your decision to subscribe, I assume you are a curious person with a desire to learn.

That’s great—my newsletter is crafted specifically with people like you in mind. But learning should not be done on your own in a dark room–it’s best done together. The best results are achieved when we learn in a community or with a group of friends.

So let’s make this interaction a two-way street. If you have time, introduce yourself. In the future, if you have feedback, a question, or just to want to say hi, you can reply directly to my emails.

Now here’s something else that I wanted to share with you. Enjoy!
