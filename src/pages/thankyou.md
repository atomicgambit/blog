## Thank you for subscribing!

Thanks for reading my content! I’ll add you to the newsletter.

Every other week, I summarize high-quality insights and timeless ideas from the world’s best books and thinkers.

While you’re reading this, I’m already crafting the next issue with a team of philosophers, medical doctors, thought leaders, authors and scientists. I am very proud to be part of this team. By now, we’ve written millions of books and improved the lives of billions. But there’s probably one thing you should know about them.

Most of my team members are dead. Some of them don’t even know I exist.

But that’s okay. They left their knowledge in a place that was easy to access, and millions of people field-tested and improved their ideas. Their knowledge allowed humanity to become the most powerful species that this planet has ever seen.

Pretty amazing. We should enjoy it while we can, because we don’t know how long it will last.

In the meantime, we can do humanity a favor by spreading their best ideas and improving the ones that still need work.

I hope these ideas will serve you as well as they served me.

Welcome to the community!
