Are you aware of the courage-effect?

It’s a phenomenon where everythings sounds better when you slap courage in front of it.
Take for example a student who is constantly asking stupid questions. You can frame it in two ways.

“He is asking stupid questions” is one way.

This kind of framing makes it seem that he is in fact stupid, or that he always comes to classes unprepared.
Even though it’s not explicitly mentioned.

Now read what happens when I frame it somewhat differently.

“He has the courage to ask stupid questions”.

Sounds different right?

Maybe now we even find ourselves respecting the guy.
We think: “Damn, it’s almost noble that he has the guts to ask stupid questions like that.”
That’s what happens when you slap “courage” in front of something.

I have more examples.

“He has the courage to lie.”

This makes it sound like he is lying to protect someone, even though it’s not implied. It could also be a guy who is cheating on his girlfriend.

“She has the courage to admit her defeat.”

It's amazing that she has the courage to do that!
Even though it could also be someone who gambled all her savings at the casino, and finally decides to quit.

Ichiro Kishimi recently used this trick for the title of a book.
I found the book interesting, but not nearly as great as the title suggested.
It was called “The Courage to be Disliked”.
And I think we all need some of that courage.
I even think it's essential for a good life.

## The desire for recognition

Maybe you are thinking: “”Why the fuck would I want to be disliked in the first place?”
True, most of us tend to see being disliked as a bad thing.
But if you want to live a good life, being disliked is actually a welcome necessity.

Let me first reverse the problem and start with the obvious: it’s impossible for everyone to like you.
It’s statistically and logically impossible.
Just being a certain way makes you more attractive to like-minded people and more repelling to other kinds of people.
And in some cases, people may dislike you based on reasons you can’t even change.

But most of us find this hard to accept.
It’s common for people to desire the approval of everyone around them.
This was a useful strategy for our ancestors, when we mostly lived in small bands and tribes.

However, we don’t live in tribes of 30 individuals anymore.
We live in societies of millions.
And when we try so hard to be liked by all the people around us, we create our own problems.

The need to be liked–or the desire for recognition–gets in the way of living a life of social freedom.

Social freedom is the ability to:

1. Make decisions according to what you think is right.
2. Not worry about what others think of you.

But when you need people to like you, this is impossible.
You are constantly worried about what so-and-so is thinking.
This prevents you from doing anything useful–most of your time will be spent pleasing others and choosing a path that upsets the least amount of people.

Someone who desires recognition, fears its opposite–social rejection, disapproval and criticism.
They view valuable feedback as personal attacks and small social setbacks as major blows to their reputation.

It also affects one of the most important skills in life.

Because they don’t want to be disliked, they become unable to say no.
So they say yes to everything and everyone, at the cost of saying no to themselves.

They are fragile because their whole identity is built upon the approval of others.

People who live like this are not free.
They are slaves to the opinions of others.

## Freedom is being disliked

When you are okay with being disliked, you will enjoy some great advantages.

1. **You can say no more often.** We all say yes too much. Saying no puts you back in control, and creates room for things that are worth saying yes to.

2. **You stop worrying about what others think of you.** True confidence is not “they will like me”. True confidence is: “I will be fine even if they dislike me.”

3. **You are exercising your freedom.** You get into the habit of making decisions according to what you want. The fear of criticism and disapproval stops holding you back.

4. **Growth from feedback.** The best way to learn is from doing and feedback. Criticism becomes a tool for improvement, instead of a personal attack. After a while, you will even welcome criticism.

5. **You become more authentic.** That voice that you have been ignoring in order to fit in, slowly starts waking from its slumber. Being authentic is all about getting back in touch with that voice. And that’s when the interesting things happen. It may cause you to rethink life decisions that you are about to make (or already have made) mostly because of others, while neglecting your own opinion.

Slowly, you start living your own life instead of the life of someone else.

But this is all easier said than done.
Actually being okay with being disliked is hard.
It’s _uncomfortable._
And our brain does not like discomfort.
So we need to practice a specific skill.
A skill that accepts discomfort, and follows through regardless.

## Courage

Courage is what we use to face discomfort and make changes in our life.
It’s what makes us step outside of our comfort zone.
Without courage, meaningful growth is impossible, because growth often involves doing things that you normally wouldn’t do.
Someone without courage contemplates change, but finds the discomfort of changing too much to handle.

This is why being disliked is so amazing.
When we are being disliked, life gifts us with the opportunity to practice courage.
It challenges us to accept discomfort and to continue anyway.
Courage is essential for a good life.
It carries over to other areas of your life and makes you a better person.
That is the beauty of practicing the courage to be disliked.

Sometimes we need courage to be disliked by the people close to us.

My parents (like probably most asian parents) are often disappointed in me.
They have this “great plan” about where I should work and live, what my relationships should look like and how I should spend my money and free time.

I don’t agree with most of it.
I often remind myself that it is not my job to satisfy all their expectations and make them happy.
All I can do is live my own life, according to my own principles.
To enjoy that freedom, I need courage.
The courage to disappoint my parents.
