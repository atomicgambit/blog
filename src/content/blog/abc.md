description: A simple tool to manage stress, inspired by the emergency care department.

It’s around 02:00 in the night and I am dozing off in the break room of the emergency care, together with some of my colleagues.
It’s one of the first nightshifts of my internship, and it’s been quiet for the last few hours.
The lights are off.
Some of us are sleeping.

I am lying on a couch, trying to do the same, but I’ve never been a good couch-sleeper.

The phone rings.
My colleague–the doctor I have been shadowing like a loyal dog for the last few days–picks it up.

I see her scrabbling a few things down on the notebook she carries around.
Then she ends the phone call and looks at me and the nurses.
“52-year-old male, intubated and unconscious, blood pressure of 82/50 and a saturation of 88%, he’s on his way right now.”

We stand up and slowly make our way to the room where we will receive the patient.
Some words are exchanged but it’s mostly quiet.
Most are too tired for small talk.
I remember looking around me and seeing a group of sleepy-faced red-eyed individuals, all of us slowly starting to wake up from the bright lights of the emergency room.

It didn’t seem to matter.
By now I had seen this team in action frequently.
Without fail, every time, they know what to do, no matter the circumstances.
It’s been drilled into them through years of experience, and it was slowly starting to get drilled into me.

When a patient comes in close to dying with all kinds of medical problems, it may seem too overwhelming.
The untrained eye sees one huge problem it can’t solve: a patient dying of unknown causes.
On the other hand, the trained eye sees multiple smaller problems that seem solvable.
And it sees this even when it was sleeping a few moments ago.

The trained eye acts according to the guiding principle of emergency care: “Treat first what kills first”.
It ensures that they don’t get overwhelmed and always know what actions to take.

And coincidentally, it’s also one of the best techniques you can apply for stressful situations everywhere–even in your personal life.
Here’s what we can learn from their motto.

## Treat first what kills first

Treat first what kills first is a framework for emergency care personnel that does exactly what it says: it helps them prioritize the most deadly problems.
They do this by using an ABCDE checklist.

- A: Airway and severe bleeding. If someone has an obstructed airway, the patient will choke to death before you can do anything. Severe bleeding likewise has to be stopped before you do the rest of the checklist.
- B: Breathing Pulmonary problems are second. Without enough oxygenation to the brain the human body won’t survive for long.
- C: Circulation Blood pressure and heart problems are the third stop. A high enough blood flow is needed for sufficient perfusion of the brain and other organs. We also check for major fractures, because they can result in severe blood loss if left untreated.
- D: Disability We perform some neurological tests to find out if someone’s intoxicated, having a stroke or some other neurological emergency.
- E: Environment This involves measuring the body temperature and screening for small wounds/fractures.

When you divide a huge problem into 5 smaller problems, the problems seem much more manageable.

“Oh shit, he’s dying what do I do?” becomes “Let's first check if the airway is obstructed.”

After learning the ABCDE and the “Treat first what kills first” motto, I noticed that it started popping up everywhere.

In the book “Extreme Ownership”, navy SEAL officers used a similar motto in the warzone in Afghanistan. They just called it something else–Prioritize and Execute.

Whenever they faced an overwhelming situation (for example gun fights), they divided their situation into smaller problems and focused on the most important task.

In computer science, programmers use “Divide and conquer”, a way of thinking to find the most optimal solution to a complex problem. A good programmer is able to divide a big problem into subproblems, thereby making it more manageable.

## Stress

People often think that stress is caused by external events. It’s not.
The fact that some people find public speaking stressful, while others shrug it off, tells us something different.

Stress is the physical and mental reaction to what you perceive is happening.

When you are facing a huge problem, the trained eye sees all the subproblems that seem manageable, whereas the untrained eye sees one huge problem that is too much to handle.

The good news is that you can train yourself to divide your problems into subproblems. But it takes some effort. When life gives you problems, ask yourself what problems you can deal with–and which problems are outside of your control.

And of all the problems you can deal with–make them smaller–small enough that they seem easy. Focus on one thing at a time. Don’t multitask–that shit doesn’t work. Multitasking is trying to whole-ass 5 things and half-assing all of them.

Experienced doctors don’t overextend themselves–they know their limits and stick to the problem at hand. The same is true for experienced programmers and Navy SEALs. They finish one thing and then move on to the next.

If you feel overwhelmed or stressed, remember to treat first what kills first.
