title: "A Collection of my Favourite Blog Posts"
---

I have collected the best blog posts that I have read throughout the years.

They all belong to some of the most high-quality articles that you can find online.  
Some of them require a decent amount of time to get through, others only a few minutes.

My advice: don’t read them all in one day.

## Wealth creation

[How to Get Rich](https://nav.al/rich)

**Long read**

A great guide on creating wealth from someone who has done it himself.
It’s a goldmine of information with many useful ideas on how to develop yourself.
Don't be fooled by the title, he talks about much more than just money.

It takes some time to get through, but it’s worth it.  
It’s also available in podcast-format.
This is the longest one on the list, so don’t force yourself to read it all in one sitting.

[The ladders of wealth creation: a step-by-step roadmap to building wealth](https://nathanbarry.com/wealth-creation/)

**Moderate to long read**

Another great guide from the creator of a famous software company.
He shows a progression scheme in building wealth–and the skills required to climb the ladder.

## Minimalism

[Subtract](https://sive.rs/subtract)

**Short read**

You don’t need much more than this one minute blog post from Derek Sivers to understand minimalism.

## Thinking for yourself

[First Principles: The Building Blocks of True Knowledge](https://fs.blog/first-principles/)

**Moderate read**

We often think, but we don’t think about _how_ we think. 
This blog post touches on the idea of reasoning from first principles, the same way people like Elon Musk and Richard Feynman solve their problems. 

[The Cook and the Chef: Musk's Secret Sauce](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html) 

**Moderate to long read**

This one is also about reasoning from first principles, but more detailed and with stick-figure drawings. Elon Musk liked this blogger so much that he asked him to do a whole series about him. 

## Where are the aliens?

[The Fermi Paradox](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html)

**Moderate to long read**

A blog post that explains why we haven’t found aliens (yet). This article always leaves me with existential intrigue and wonder. 

## Why facts don’t change our mind

[Why facts don’t change our mind](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds)

**Short to moderate read**

I love to discuss all kinds of things with my friends. 
I also like watching other people argue, even though I don’t like politics. 

All these discussions have one thing in common: rarely does someone change their mind. 

This article illustrates the difficulty of changing someone’s mind and teaches some great life lessons along the way. 

# Learning

[The Buffett Formula: Going to Bed Smarter Than When You Woke Up](https://fs.blog/the-buffett-formula/)

**Short to moderate read**

Excellence is nearby–no matter what industry you work in–for the person who can stay curious and loves to learn.  
And the best tool for learning is reading. Daily. 

[Learn In Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public)

**Short read**

This blog post opened my eyes to the power of learning in public. 
I was not the only one he affected–he inspired a whole movement with this blog post. 

## Building a following

[1000 true fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/)

**Short read**

I revisit this blog post once in a while to remind myself that you don’t need to impact millions to make a living–whether you are a small business or an internet creator. 

## Live advice from hundreds of readers

[10 Life Lessons to Excel in Your 30s](https://markmanson.net/10-life-lessons-excel-30s)

**Short to moderate read**

Mark Manson emailed one question to his older (above 37 years old) readers: What advice would you give your 30-year-old self? Hundreds of people responded. Even though I am not 30, it was very insightful to see how similar most of their answers were. 

It turns out that we often regret the same things when we look back on life. So this article is a great read, especially for young people.
