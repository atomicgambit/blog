Some people are experts at breaking down complicated problems and generating unique solutions.

They do this with a skill called “reasoning from first principles”.
Physicists are great examples of first-principle thinkers.
Their unique way of thinking can be used in a lot of different fields.
That’s why you can find them in a variety of places–even at places that don’t require knowledge of physics. 

For example, in the Netherlands, most of them end up in the corporate world. They work at:

- Banks
- Consultancies
- Management positions
- Data analysts positions
- Research/development departments

But you don’t need to work in these fields to benefit from first-principle thinking. 
It can be useful in any field, including your personal life. 

A famous example of someone who embodies first-principle thinking is Elon Musk. 
Take his thought process as to how he decided to build SpaceX. 

>I tend to approach things from a physics framework. Physics teaches you to reason from first principles rather than by analogy. So I said, okay, let’s look at the first principles. What is a rocket made of? Aerospace-grade aluminum alloys, plus some titanium, copper, and carbon fiber. Then I asked, what is the value of those materials on the commodity market? It turned out that the materials cost of a rocket was around two percent of the typical price.

He's often seen as a genius (or an idiot, depending on who you ask) but his thought process is not that difficult to follow. 
First principle thinking has the effect of making people seem like a genius, because of how rare it is. 

First principle thinking requires starting from the fundamentals and reasoning your way up to a solution. Aristotle defined a first principle as “the first basis from which a thing is known.”
Reasoning from first principles is a skill. 
Everyone who wants to think for themselves should learn to reason from first principles. 
We can learn this by focusing on 4 things.

To reason from first principles, you need to:

1. Stop copying
2. Doubt more
3. Have a firm grasp of the basics
4. Be curious

## Stop copying

If Henry Ford was a copycat, he never would have launched an automobile company. 

>If I had asked my customers what they wanted they would have said a faster horse.
-Henry Ford

When a copycat tries to improve the speed of transportation, he limits himself by choosing from a box of solutions that have been tried before. 
He treats the problem like a multiple-choice problem, never considering a realm of different alternatives that require inventive solutions. 

A first-principle thinker considers the question: “What other transport options are possible?” and reasons his way to an answer based on his current knowledge. 

We often, consciously or subconsciously, copy others. 
And with good reason.
When we copy others, we are using options with a proven track record. 
That which has been successful in the past, may prove successful in the future as well. 
But it also results in a bias–we are less likely to consider things that haven’t been tried. 
But sometimes, the best solutions require novel ideas and out-of-the-box thinking.

And sometimes, these solutions are within arms reach, but you won't be able to see it, if you never ask yourself what else is possible. 

## Doubt more

We often blindly assume our knowledge to be true. 

> Dogma: a principle or set of principles laid down by an authority as incontrovertibly true.

Dogma thinking is the natural enemy of first principle reasoning.  
When you believe things to be undisputable, you stop doubting. 
And when you stop doubting, you stop asking the right questions. 
Asking the right questions is fundamental for reasoning from first principles. 

> The first principle is that you must not fool yourself–and you are the easiest person to fool.

-_Richard Feynman_

The Church fooled themselves when they believed that the sun revolved around the earth.
Flood geologists fooled themselves when they believed (some still do) the earth to be younger than 6000 years. 
Before Bill Gates came along, companies fooled themselves into thinking that money could only be made with hardware.
Doctors fooled themselves and the whole population by making commercials for cigarettes, claiming that smoking was healthy. 

We should assume that we have blind spots–and the only way to find them is with a healthy amount of doubt. When you’re trying to solve meaningful problems that require unique solutions, doubt is your friend. 

## Have a firm grasp of the basics

To reason from first principles, you need to _know_ the first principles. 
This is harder than you think. 

We often learn things by memorization and analogies, instead of true understanding. 

That’s because true understanding is difficult and takes time. Despite that, it’s still one of the best investments you can make. 
Once you firmly grasp the basics, your ability to reason from first principles will skyrocket. 

To find out if you know the basics, you can:

- Ask questions to yourself (Socratic questioning). Play the “why game” with yourself. If you already get stuck after a few questions, you don’t have a firm grasp on the basics.
- Teach others. The better you understand something, the easier you can explain it. If you find yourself struggling to explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough. Teach the basics to find your blind spots. 

## Be curious

Getting good at something you’re curious about is easy. 
In contrast, getting good at something you find boring is incredibly difficult. 

The most successful people in any industry are curious about their field and it shows–they love to learn and continue to improve. 

Curiosity can be learned. 
When you were 5 years old, you were curious about everything. 
But everybody told you to shut up, so you stopped asking questions–and you stopped being curious. 

In my experience, the best way to be more curious is to read more. 

Read what you love until you love to read.
After you love to read,  you will fall in love with learning. 
And when you love to learn, you will naturally grow more curious–and start asking questions again. 

There are probably more ways to fall in love with learning, but this is what worked for me. 

## Acting on first principles

Besides reasoning from first principles there is another aspect that’s often overlooked. 

When you reason from first principles, you’ll find that some of your ideas are contrarian.
These contrarian ideas often seem absurd when people propose them, but perfectly logical in hindsight. 

Galileo famously defended the proposition that the Earth revolved around the sun. This idea was so contrarian at the time that the Church jailed him. 

Similarly, Steve Jobs is praised as a genius, but his contrarian ideas were initially met with a lot of skepticism. Most people didn’t believe him when he predicted that every household would have a computer.
He kept believing, and his bet paid off.

Acting on first principles requires the belief that you’re right, even when others think you’re wrong. 
It requires courage–[the courage to be disliked.](https://vitosarchive.com/posts/courage/) 

There is one caveat here–the belief that you’re right when others think you’re wrong can backfire if your first principles are lacking. 
Flat-earthers are a great case study in that regard. 

## Final thoughts

Reasoning from first principles is demanding and takes time. 
That’s why it’s not feasible to be a first-principle thinker in every aspect of your life. 
Copying others can be a valuable strategy to save time. 
But some of our most important decisions in life require unique solutions–for example, choosing a career that suits you. 
In our jobs, we often face specific problems unique to our field that benefit from first-principle thinking. 

You’ll often face tough decisions or situations that require great solutions–instead of okay solutions. That’s where reasoning from first principles truly shines.  

So what's stopping you from learning this skill?
In a world of copy-cats, people who can think for themselves are a welcome and necessary addition.
